            King Eagle is for the most elite of the players only. The concept though, is simple. First, you need to collect as many building materials as possible (wood works fine.) After that, you need to proceed to the very edge of the map; this can be very time consuming so time is a factor. Once at the edge, you need to build up as high as you can, as fast as you can. Once you have reached maximum height, you do your best to stay out of sight from other players. From that point, all you have to do is build your way to the center of the eye, where you are guaranteed to be 1 on 1 with the last player. However, you are also very high in the air, and any drop will kill you; this is where the skill comes in. Good luck.
