            Bush camping in Fortnite is an extremely sensitive topic. Essentially, the idea is that you would start off as normal; drop in, find a gun, etc. Once you have done all that, what you want to do is find any bush (preferably in an open field) and simply enter the bush, as shown below. Once this has been completed, you may than proceed to "camp" inside of said bush, until someone runs right by you; giving you a chance at an easy kill and a lot of loot.
